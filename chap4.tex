	In Chapter~\ref{chap:three} we discussed three different simulation experiments. Here we look at the compression experiment with ten fibers. As before we have a set of reference parameters (see Table~\ref{table:manyfiber_reference}). We run the compression experiment for the reference parameters and three variations of the parameters, specifically varying $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\eps_+$.

The configurations to the right and below correspond to an increasing $\mu$ and increasing $\lambda$ respectively. All configurations use the reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:manyfiber_reference}.
		\label{fig:grid}}
	\end{figure}
	
	We consider nine simulations with values of $\lambda = 5, 15, 25$ and $\mu = 0, 5, 10$. In Figure~\ref{fig:grid} we see a high level view of each simulation for the reference parameters. Keeping the horizontal component of the load zero, we see that the fibers get increasingly bent as we increase $\lambda$. One explanation for this is that the torsional and extensible springs do not have enough time to slide along the top substrate and align to it before the top substrate compresses the fibers to the point of adhering to the bottom substrate. Note that in order to slide either the substrate or the fiber must have nonzero vertical displacement. Therefore, once pinned between the top and bottom substrates, the fibers have less freedom to slide. As the magnitude of the vertical component of the load is increased the fibers become more likely to buckle.

If we increase the horizontal component of the load the story changes. We are able to maintain the aligned compressed configuration for larger magnitudes of the load if the horizontal component is sufficiently large. It would seem that the ratio between vertical and horizontal component for the reference parameters is the deciding factor for whether or not fibers will buckle. This is analogous to crushed configurations for $\theta$ near $0$\textdegree\ and flattened configurations for increased $\theta$ in Chapter~\ref{chap:three}. Fibers becoming flattened and aligned with sufficiently large horizontal component of the load or ``crushed'' with sufficiently large vertical component qualitatively matches experimental observations of CNT forests compressed between rigid substrates \cite{Qu2008}.

		\caption{Equilibrium configurations of varying loads. All configurations are directly comparable to Figure~\ref{fig:grid} with the exception that $\beta = 100$.
		\label{fig:grid_b100}}
	\end{figure}

	In Figure~\ref{fig:grid_b100} we increase $\beta$ to one hundred. This is an order of magnitude increase from the reference parameters and it prevents buckling at all selected loads. Qualitatively there is no discernible difference in any of the nine simulations with the one exception that the fibers buckle to the left with no horizontal component of the load. The ``crushed'' configurations of the reference parameters no longer occur similar to the single fiber situation. Although the single bend of a fiber for one fiber only occurred for $\beta=1000$ perhaps the inter-fiber vdW interaction reinforces this configuration.

			\includegraphics[scale=1]{./fig/ch4/grid_g1000.eps}

		\caption{Equilibrium configurations of varying loads. All configurations are directly comparable to Figure~\ref{fig:grid} with the exception that $\gamma = 1000$.
		\label{fig:grid_g1000}}
	\end{figure}
	
	We observe that the increase in the torsional spring strength prevents bending from happening anywhere except at the junction between the fiber and the substrate. On the other hand when we increase the extensible spring constant by an order of magnitude the buckling patterns are the same as those observed for the reference parameters. Comparing Figure~\ref{fig:grid_g1000} to Figure~\ref{fig:grid}, the same kinds of configurations are present in both. With $\gamma$ sufficiently large and vdW sufficiently weak, further increasing $\gamma$ plays a negligible role because the distance between particles on a fiber is already close to $\ell$.

		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[scale=1]{./fig/ch4/grid_et0.1.eps}
		\end{center}		
		\caption{Equilibrium configurations of varying loads. All configurations are directly comparable to Figure~\ref{fig:grid} with the exception that $\eps_+ = 0.1$.
		\label{fig:grid_et0.1}}
	\end{figure}

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
Next, consider the situation when all vdW strengths in the system are the same. In Figure~\ref{fig:grid_et0.1} we reduce $\eps_+$ to 0.1 and present the results for nine different loads while keeping the rest of the parameters equal to the reference values. For $\mu = 0$ or $5$ the configurations are comparable. We further observe that the horizontal component of the load can be strong enough to overpower the vdW interaction and cause the top substrate to slide off the fibers. This happens for all values of the vertical component of the load that we have considered when $\mu = 10$.
	
	Although we focus primarily on the model for only a single fiber, our simulation code is designed for arbitrarily many and arbitrarily large fibers. Investigating the single fiber case does give us some insight into how many fibers will behave as well.

\section{Future work}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:three} we explored three numerical experiments.
The compression experiment was explored briefly here, but the detachment experiment was not explored at all.
Overcoming numerical difficulties connected to much larger sizes of the simulation for both compression and detachment is a significant issue that we have not addressed.
Coarse-grained approaches like molecular dynamics approaches scale with parallelization very well and that could be used to evolve large scale systems over long time steps.
GPGPU frameworks like CUDA and OpenCL with specialized hardware like that of a Tesla C2050 allow for effective parallelization of this kind.
In particular, GPGPU solutions can be used to practically handle hundreds of thousands of particles at the same time scales presented here.
Although a GPGPU approach will improve the computational efficiency it comes with an implementation cost.
The use of the SUNDIALS software package in this work alleviates some of that cost by requiring only a custom N\_Vector implementation as a minimum amount of effort to use the code with a GPU.
However, implementing a custom matrix solver would likely improve performance as well because the supplied parallel solvers of SUNDIALS do not leverage a GPUs architecture.
All of our numerical experiments assume a set of reference parameters as a starting point for exploring equilibrium configurations.
In Section 3.2 we note that with large torsional spring strength, $\beta = 1000$, the configurations and behavior of a single fiber is in agreement with fiber adhesion continuum models.
However, all of our experiments use $\beta$ of smaller value which bias results to a predominantly ``sticky'' fiber.
Further exploration where the work needed to break surface adhesion between the fiber and top substrate is weaker is needed.
