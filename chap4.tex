\chapter{Many fiber simulations}

Similar to a single fiber case, the moving substrate is pushed into the forest, compressing the fibers until an equilibrium is reached. This force is then relaxed. A similar set of case studies are then applied to the many fiber case in order to find the minimum necessary magnitude to pull off the moving substrate.
