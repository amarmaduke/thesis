Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit exceptional thermal, mechanical, and electronic properties and hence are of interest for potential applications in novel materials and devices. To develop these applications, researchers must achieve a better understanding of how to process and manipulate CNTs at the nanoscale. Toward this goal, here we propose a coarse-grained model to describe the mechanical response of a CNT forest compressed between two rigid substrates. We use the model to make qualitative and quantitative predictions and to conduct a set of parametric studies. The behavior of the system observed in these studies qualitatively matches the experiments on surface adhesion.
