\chapter{Single fiber simulations}

Although coarse-grained models of a similar nature can and have been fitted to match the properties of a CNT \cite{Cranford2010}, here we focus on exploring the behavior of the model. To that end we are interested in four stages of the model. First, under what circumstances will a fiber not crystallize with the bottom substrate. Second, what configurations or modes of failure are relevant and observable from various loads applied to the fiber by the top substrate. Third, after being equilibrated in an adhered state (that is, the top substrate adhered to the fiber), what kinds of loads are required to detach the top substrate from the fiber and what configurations are observable intermittently. Finally, if the fiber does successfully detach, under what circumstances will it not crystallize with the bottom substrate.

\section{Free standing}

	\end{figure}	

We say a fiber, or part of a fiber, is \textit{crystallized} if the van der Waals energy between a set of particles appears qualitatively to be minimized. If a particle on the fiber is crystallized with two particles on the top substrate we say that it is \textit{adhered} to the top substrate. We define a function to describe how adhered a fiber is to the top substrate in general. Therefore, we define


\begin{eqnarray}
	A(\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}) = \left\{ 
		\begin{array}{ll}
			1, & \|\textbf{a} - \textbf{b}\| \leq 2^{\frac{1}{6}} \sigma + 10^{-6}\\
			0, & \mbox{otherwise}
		\end{array}
		\right.  \\
	A^+ = \sum_{k=1}^{n^+} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} A(\textbf{r}_i^{(j)},\textbf{r}_k^{(+)}) \label{eqn:adhesion:top} \\ 
	A^- = \sum_{k=1}^{n^-} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} A(\textbf{r}_i^{(j)},\textbf{r}_k^{(-)}) \label{eqn:adhesion:bottom}
\end{eqnarray}

If a fiber is not strong enough to prevent crystallization with the bottom substrate without external influence then it is impossible that the fiber will be about to recover from a detachment force. Moreover, the compression with the top substrate will be uninteresting if the fiber is already laying flat in a position the substrate can not effect. Therefore it is pertinent to categorize what parameters cause a fiber to stay upright or at least not crystallize in some capacity. Here we show that $\beta$ and $\eps^-$ play the key role in whether or not the fiber crystallizes (Fig.~\ref{fig:FreeStandingGrid}). The only other parameters that could play a role are: $\sigma$, $\ell$, $\eps$, and $gamma$. With the exception of $\eps$ none of these parameters will have any effect on keeping the fiber standing, but more how the fiber crystallizes or stacks with the bottom substrate. The inner fiber van der Waals interaction strength, $\eps$, is assumed to play a negligible role.

The modes a fiber free from the top substrate are categorizable as collapsed, folded, crystallized, and slanted. These can be immediately seen in figure \ref{fig:FreeStandingGrid}. The white section sufficiently distant from the origin is slanted, the black section above it collapsed, and sufficiently close to the y-axis is crystallized.

Focusing on the slanted mode it is suggested from figure \ref{fig:FreeStandingGrid} that as $\beta$ increases the ability to be slanted does so as well. If we are to look at a fiber in equilibrium near the x-axis we would see figure \ref{subfig:fs_erect} with an indistinguishable slant from being completely up right. As we increase $\eps^-$ from this position the fiber will begin to slant more dramatically. The slant in fiber will be mostly, if not completely, caused by a buckling at the root (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:fs_erectlean}). This can be understood for two reasons. First, the first particle on the fiber that can be bent by van der Waals is also closest to the bottom substrate and thus under it's greatest strain. Second, if the force pulling on the first particle is not strong enough to cause it to crystallize, then surely it will be significantly weaker for the second particle in the chain. This observation implies another important fact, namely, that if the van der Waals interaction can crystallize with the bottom substrate, then the entire fiber will collapse. The immediate change from the slanted mode to the collapsed mode is explained by this importance on the strength of the first torsional spring.
	
The continued increase in $\eps^-$ pushes the mode from slanted to collapsed and near the darkest areas we have a completely collapsed fiber (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:fs_down}). There is another sharp jump as we continue increasing $\eps^-$. The fiber switches from being completely collapsed with the bottom substrate to folding in on itself during the collapsing (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:fs_onefold}). As $\beta$ becomes too weak to maintain a stiffness to the fiber a buckle forms as it collapses. With particles on the fiber collapsing quickly the short-range nature of van der Waals leaves particles just far enough to be left "on top" of previous collapsing particles, only to quickly be taken over by the van der Waals interaction between the bottom substrate and also now the inter-fiber interaction, causing a fold. As we increase $\eps^-$ the number of folds increase as well (see Fig.~\ref{subfig:fs_manyfold}).
	
Moving towards the y-axis we find ourselves encountering a less predictable beast. With $\beta$ very weak there are several crystallization effects that happen to the fiber (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fs_crystal}). In all examples shown the crystallization is primarily inter-fiber. That is, the fiber doesn't seem to collapse, so much as crystallize with itself before it can. (TODO need precise values for these examples, and really all the above figures)

The compression of a fiber by a load is likely to cause it to buckle. We investigate here under what parameters it will buckle and how it buckles. In all simulations the fiber starts standing vertically and in equilibrium (under the equilibrium criteria described in Chapter~\ref{chap:two}). The top substrate starts a distance far enough away from the fiber so that the cut off Lennard-Jones prevents it from interacting. The experiment begins with a load on the top substrate moving it towards the fiber and bottom substrate. In every configuration we have found under this experiment there is some degree of crystallization between particles on the fiber and particles on the top substrate. Therefore we use the adhesion metric (see Equation~\ref{eqn:adhesion:top}) to differentiate between different buckling configurations. All experiments are done against a set of reference parameters (see Table~\ref{table:compression_reference}). These values have minor significance; a value is chosen to be one unless there is otherwise reason not to. The starting position and particle count for substrates are chosen so that if a fiber were to collapse under any extreme it doesn't run out of particles on either substrate to interact with. This is a guarantee for the bottom substrate based on the chosen values but the top substrate can still ``miss'' the fiber since it has only finitely many particles. Both $\gamma$ and $\beta$ were selected to keep the fiber vertical when not under load, and $\delta$ was chosen to be zero for aesthetics.

\subsection{Observations of Reference Parameters}

Given the reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:compression_reference} we have a diagram, Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:vanilla}, demonstrating different buckling configurations after the system is in equilibrium. There is one configuration we focus on in detachment specifically that we can observe. The fiber is said to be \textit{flattened} between the top and bottom substrate when it has completely crystallized with the top substrate and no torsional spring, with the exception of the root, is bent (see Figure~\ref{subfig:push_squished}). This is the starting configuration, after relaxation, for the detachment experiment. Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:vanilla} also demonstrates a relationship between an angled load and a flattened configuration. The fiber is said to have a \textit{fold} when one or more particle of the fiber has crystallized with other particles on the fiber. When the load is near $\frac{\pi}{2}$ we start to see folds (see Figure~\ref{fig:push_fold}). When the substrate is even closer, or directly down, the fiber starts to buckle immediately causing more folds in configurations as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:push_curled}.

Flattened fibers occur under these parameters when the angle of the load is sufficiently away from $\frac{\pi}{2}$. An explanation for this behavior is that as the fiber buckles it crystallizes with the top substrate and is sheared by the horizontal component of the load to be ``zipped'' to the top substrate. A fiber \textit{zips} (or \textit{unzips}) from a substrate when one particle crystallizes (or breaks crystallization) at a time and in rapid succession. Therefore if the load is closer to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ it loses the shearing component and no longer causes the fiber to zip.

\subsection{Observations Increasing $\beta$}

Increasing $\beta$ shows a shrinking region for folding fibers under any load in Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:b100} and Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:b1000}. This suggests that folding in a fiber is a relation between $\beta$ and van der Waals (i.e. $\eps$ and $\eps^+$). The explanation being that folds can only occur when the top substrate is not causing the fiber to zip, either by load or overpowering van der Waals, and when $\beta$ is weak enough. If $\beta$ is strong enough to prevent folding it would suggest that the torsional springs are breaking crystallization with the top substrate as it compresses the fiber to shift more particles against the top substrate. As $\beta$ increases it would then become strong enough to break increasingly more crystallized particles with the top substrate to prevent a fold. Figure~\ref{subfig:push_b100_low_mag} and Figure~\ref{subfig:push_b100_high_mag} show configurations of different magnitude at $\beta = 10$ and how folds can still occur. Figure~\ref{subfig:push_b1000_bend} shows a configuration where no folding occurs. We also see that sufficiently strong $\beta$ and sufficiently weak magnitude of the load prevent a flattened configuration. We would expect the number of particles on the fiber that adhere to the top substrate to reduce if we continued to increase $\beta$.

\subsection{Observations Decreasing $\eps^-$ and $\eps^+$} \label{subsection:push:eps}

An order of magnitude decrease in $\eps^-$ seems to play no qualitative role in equilibrium configurations, at least with the selected reference parameters (see Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:eb0.1}). However, an order of magnitude decrease in $\eps^+$ plays a significant role (see Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:et0.1}). The shear component of the load instead of causing the fiber to zip to the top substrate causes the top substrate to slide off. That is, the van der Waals interaction is not strong enough for large shear components or large magnitudes to hold or adhere to the fiber. Even so and angled load is necessary to cause a flattened configuration, but the region of angles that cause folding as increased. This is because with sufficiently small shear component will cause the fiber to buckle and then van der Waals interaction between particles on the fiber will be the dominate force as the fiber zips against itself. The isolated white regions of Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:et0.1} are of a ``hump'' configuration (see Figure~\ref{fig:push_hump}). The hump is caused by the fiber zipping to the bottom substrate with fold immediately at the root causing a ``hump''. The top substrate is then only adhered to a single particle of the fiber. If both $\eps^-$ and $\eps^+$ are decreased by an order of magnitude then we have a similar diagram as with only $\eps^-$ being reduced but the ``hump'' configuration is lost (see Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:eb0.1_et0.1}). This variation from the reference parameters weakens adhesion of all van der Waals interactions between the fiber and either substrate but keeps the same interaction between particles on the fiber with other particles on the fiber. Therefore, folding is more prominent for the same reasons that folding was more prominent when only $\eps^-$ was decreased.

\subsection{Observations Increasing $\gamma$}

An order of magnitude increase in $\gamma$ has no observable effect (see Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:g1000}). The purpose of $\gamma$ is to keep the particles a fixed distance apart but allow for some relaxation. If $\gamma$ were very large we might expect the bonds to be too stiff and prevent crystallization. However, the uniform spacing between particles on the substrates and the ideal spacing, $\ell$, of particles on the fiber allow for at least some crystallization regardless of how stiff the extensible spring is made to be. Intuitively, it would seem that even with very stiff extensible springs the diagram would still not vary significantly from Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid}.

\subsection{Replacing Atomized Bottom Substrate with Pressure}

Up until now all experiments have been done with a bottom substrate comprised of contiguous particles. However, varying the van der Waals strength of these particles with particles of the fiber didn't have any qualitative effect as shown in Subsection~\ref{subsection:push:eps}. We might ask if particles on the bottom substrate are necessary at all to the behavior of the fiber. Thus, we remove all particles on the bottom substrate and replace the van der Waals interaction with a pressure (see Figure~\ref{fig:PushGrid:p1}. \textbf{TODO}(introduce the equation here? In Chapter 2?) We can see some general similarities between the reference diagram and a bottom substrate replaced with pressure. However, there are also some noticeable anomalies. There are ``hump'' like configurations and different folding behavior. \textbf{TODO}(I don't have an explanation)

%How the fiber deforms under compression, in particular the amount of the fiber under contact, is a question that has been asked and answered in other contexts
\textbf{TODO}(Cite Majidi and He).

\section{Detachment}

After a fiber has been compressed under the load of the upper substrate, and then relaxed, we next look at the minimum detachment magnitude. That is, for a given angle, $\theta$, what is the minimum magnitude, $\sqrt{\mu^2 + \lambda^2}$, such that the upper substrate will break the vdW forces adhering it to the fiber. The fiber and substrate start in a state satisfying the same equilibrium criteria (see Chapter~\ref{chap:two}) of the compression experiment and is also flattened. A load is applied on the upper substrate at several different angles and we bisect the minimum detachment magnitude for each angle.

\subsection{Observations of Reference Parameters}

Again we have a set of reference parameters shown in Table~\ref{table:detachment_reference}. We use the same the adhesion heuristic to measure to attempt to capture different modes in the simulation. For compression this heuristic was more useful because the fiber and upper substrate were guaranteed to be adhered. Considering detachment we show the heuristic for simulations that are smaller than the minimum detachment magnitude. In Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid} we see the minimum detachment magnitude and dots representing individual simulations. For the reference parameters, when we have no shearing component of the load we see that the upper substrate must break all vdW bonds simultaneously in order to detach. That means there is no intermediate detachment state where some bonds are broken and others not. This same behavior seems to be the case for any angle but that begs the question of why the required magnitude is not uniform. In fact there is a propagating wave originating at the root of the fiber that reduces the required magnitude to break the vdW bonds. The minimum detachment magnitude thus becomes a function of the angle of the load as some angles are better suited for allowing a wave to form at the root. We discuss this method of detachment in more detail in Section~\ref{section:detachment:eps} and~\ref{section:detachment:pressure}.

\subsection{Varying $\beta$}

We start with reference parameter that put $\beta$ at a value too small to allow the fiber to stand up on it's on, because of this we only focus on increasing $\beta$. With one order of magnitude we don't see much of a qualitative difference (see Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:b10}), but after a two degrees of magnitude we can see an asymmetry (see Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:b100}). With a stronger torsional spring the direction the fiber is flattened becomes more important. Once the load is sufficient the shift the root and generate a wave the stronger torsional spring causes the propagating wave's amplitude to reduce but it's phase to increase. Thus, there is a smaller surface area of the fiber that the upper substrate has to break free from for a long period of time. We would guess that with further increase in $\beta$ we would see a more pronounced asymmetry up to some diminishing returns because of the finite length of the fiber.[This is just conjecture at the moment]

\subsection{Varying $\eps^-$, $\eps^+$, and $\eps$} \label{section:detachment:eps}

For the same reason we only increase $\beta$, here we only decrease the vdW strengths. Our first interest is in decreasing $\eps^-$ only. Here we notice an exception in the assumptions we've used so far. An \textit{isolated detachment} is a load that will cause the upper substrate to detach from the fiber even though with a small increase in magnitude the substrate would stay adhered. The reasons for this have much to do with the propagating wave and how the upper substrate's particles align with the fiber's particles. Even one reduction in order of magnitude of $\eps^-$ has a significant qualitative effect (see Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0.1}). The magnitude required for the upper substrate to detach is significantly less for every angle. Moreover, although the general symmetry survives to a certain point there are significantly more asymmetries. As $\eps^-$ is reduced by another order of magnitude the picture changes entirely as we can see from Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0.01}. With the adhesion between the fiber and the bottom substrate so significantly weakened the reinforcement of the flattened state is removed and allows for the upper substrate to zip free of the fiber one vdW bond at a time. Thus, the initial resistance in moving the root and causing a propagating wave is no longer the primary method of detachment and becomes the greatest hindrance instead. When $\eps^-$ is reduced to the point of vanishing this zipping around no shear component becomes more obvious as magnitude just slightly below the minimum has only one particle adhered to the upper substrate (see Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0}). It would seem then that zipping is an efficient enough method of detachment that it is easier to zip free of a bond than it is to break one. The resistance when there is primarily only a shear component again has the same difficulty as before.

In Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0.1_et0.1} we reduce both $\eps^-$, and $\eps^+$ by an order of magnitude. In comparison to the reference parameters the major difference is in the required magnitude to detach. This would seem like the obvious consequence as vdW bonds are the only reason for attachment. In Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0.1_et0.1_e0.1} $\eps$ is also reduced by an order of magnitude, but there is no qualitative difference between the two. We also increase just $\eps^+$ in one case (see Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:et10}). We can see from the figure that it is most directly comparable to Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:eb0.1}.

\subsection{Varying $\gamma$}

We increase $\gamma$ with the main motivation of making sure our selection of $\gamma$ is sufficiently large to maintain a stiffness of the fiber having strong atomic bonds between particles. Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:g1000} shows a direct similarity to the reference parameters with no discernible qualitative differences. This hints that our selection of $\gamma$ is sufficiently large to keep the bonds of the fiber stiff. The need to look at larger values of $\gamma$ in relation to other parameters is thus less important if the increased stiffness is not going to play a role in effecting, qualitatively, the behavior of the system.

\subsection{Replacing Atomized Bottom Substrate with Pressure} \label{section:detachment:pressure}

A modification to the system we described in Chapter~\ref{chap:two} places a continuum in place of an atomized bottom substrate. The same simulation procedure is used for two varying pressures shown in Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:p1} and Figure~\ref{fig:PullGrid:p10}. We can see that with small shearing component it is still increasingly difficult to detach from the fiber alone, in fact the concept of the fiber being reinforced from the bottom substrate still seems relevant. However, the continuum bottom substrate does not have the same general behavior when there is mostly only shearing component. The atomic nature of the bottom substrate in the previous examples is important in order to obtain the kind of wave behavior that we see cause local minimums.
