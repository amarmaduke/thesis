\chapter{Single fiber simulations} \label{chap:three}

We perform three numerical experiments that involve two substrates and one fiber of a reasonable length ($n=96$) in order to determine the equilibrium configurations of the substrate-fiber system. In the first experiment we study a single fiber attached to the bottom substrate. We start with a fiber perpendicular to the substrate and allow it to relax. We observe that in the absence of an external load there are two generic possibilities, either that the fiber remains free-standing or that it adheres to the substrate. We consider a particle of a fiber \textit{adhered} to a substrate if there exists a substrate particle such that the distance between both particles is approximately equal to that of the vdW equilibrium. A criterion for adhesion between two vectors describing particles of the system $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ is thus defined, 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:criterion}
	\|\textbf{a} - \textbf{b}\| \lessapprox \sigma.
\end{equation}
Further a fiber is adhered to a substrate if at least one particle of the fiber is adhered to that substrate. In our simulations we used the following heuristic for particle adhesion, 
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eqn:adhesion}
	A(\textbf{a}, \textbf{b}) &=& \left\{ 
		\begin{array}{ll}
			0, & \|\textbf{a} - \textbf{b}\| \leq 1.1 \sigma + 10^{-6}\\
			1, & \mbox{otherwise}
		\end{array}
		\right. ,  \\
	A_+ &=& \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{n_+} A(\textbf{r}_i^{(j)},\textbf{r}_k^{(+)}) \right], \label{eqn:adhesion:top} \\ 
	A_- &=& \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ 1 - \prod_{k=1}^{n_-} A(\textbf{r}_i^{(j)},\textbf{r}_k^{(-)}) \right], \label{eqn:adhesion:bottom}
\end{eqnarray}
where $A_+$ calculates the number of fiber particles adhered to the top substrate and $A_-$ calculates the number of fiber particles adhered to the bottom substrate.
Here the equilibrium distance, $\sigma$, between two particles is relaxed by $10\%$ and an additional factor of $10^{-6}$ to take into account simulation precision.
A fiber particle is counted as adhered only once, regardless of how many substrate particles it is adhered to.

The second experiment includes the top substrate with an associated load applied to it. Starting from the same initial configuration as the first experiment we observe if and how the fiber is compressed by the top substrate. This experiment is motivated by the subsequent detachment experiment. Hence we are interested in finding a load applied to the top substrate such that the equilibrium configuration has all fiber particles adhered to the bottom substrate (and thus to the top substrate).

In the third experiment we take the target equilibrium configuration obtained in the second experiment and reverse the direction of the load on the top substrate. We are interested in finding the loads that will break adhesion of the top substrate with the fiber. The adhesion heuristics (\ref{eqn:adhesion:top}) and (\ref{eqn:adhesion:bottom}) are used as a method of categorizing different equilibrium configurations for varying parameters.

\section{The free-standing fiber experiment}

The model has two kinds of pairwise bonds between particles---strong and weak. Strong bonds cannot be broken and include the extensible springs between adjacent particles on a fiber and the attachment bond to the bottom substrate. Weak bonds on the other hand can be broken and correspond to vdW interaction between various particles in the system. We considered particles weakly bonded if they satisfy the criterion (\ref{eqn:criterion}). We already defined adhesion as a weak bond between a substrate and fiber particles. Now in addition we define crystallization as another weak bond between any two non-adjacent fiber particles satisfying the same criterion. Generally our simulations show that if any two fiber particles crystallize then other fiber particles will crystallize as well.

There are three distinct regions: the black region of flattened fibers, the white region of standing or slanted fibers, and the grey sub-regions.
		\label{fig:fs}}
	\end{figure}

We say a fiber is \textit{flattened} if every particle of the fiber is adhered to the bottom substrate. If the parameters of the system are such that a fiber is flattened in the free-standing experiment then it will be flattened under any values of the external load in the compression experiment. We determine the parametric ranges for which the fiber becomes flattened. We conjecture that here the critical role is played by the torsional spring and vdW interaction between the fiber and bottom substrate. Although intra-fiber vdW interactions may also play a role we have not varied them here.

We vary $\beta$ and $\eps_-$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fs} (colored according to the value of $A_-$ in (\ref{eqn:adhesion:bottom})). If the fiber buckles then there are necessarily fiber particles that must be adhered. It must then be the case that the black region corresponds to flattened configurations only (see Figure~\ref{subfig:lazy} for example).

	\end{figure*}

The white region of the plot consists of configurations were the fiber is either orthogonal to the bottom substrate, slanted but straight, or curved.
In fact, we conjecture that a significant bend can only happen at the root, that all other bonds are negligibly bent, and that if the root particle adheres to the bottom substrate then all particles will.
Indeed, consider the initial configuration of an upright fiber, the root particle of the fiber is nearest to the bottom substrate and will experience the strongest vdW interaction with the bottom substrate relative to any other fiber particle.
If the vdW interaction causes the root particle torsional spring to bend but not adhere, then the force applied to the immediate next particle will be significantly smaller creating a negligible bend, and so on.
If the vdW interaction is strong enough to cause the root particle to adhere to the bottom substrate then the torsional spring and the vdW interaction will move the next particle into an adhered state, and then the next, and so on.
Observe the linear relationship between $\beta$ and $\eps_-$ at the dividing line between the white and black region in Figure~\ref{fig:fs} which matches our conjecture.
With sufficiently large $\beta$ relative to $\eps_-$ the fiber is not slanted (see Figure~\ref{subfig:erect}), and as $\beta$ decreases and $\eps_-$ increases, staying in the white region of Figure~\ref{fig:fs}, the fiber becomes more slanted (see Figure~\ref{subfig:leaning}).

The grey subregions of the plot are more complex and corresponds to buckling of fiber particles other than the root or fiber crystallization. Near the black region as $\eps_-$ is increased there is a gradual change from one buckle to two and so on. It appears that the particle at which buckling occurs happen to be closer to the root with increased $\eps_-$. The linear relationship between $\beta$ and $\eps_-$ is qualitatively present between not only the white and black region, but the black and grey, and different grey subregions. However, as $\beta$ decreases the slope increases. This trend hints that with smaller $\beta$ the fiber is more likely to crystallize. Crystallization for small $\beta$ is difficult to categorize with our adhesion heuristic, but Figure~\ref{fig:crystal} presents examples of  crystallized equilibrium configurations. Notice that there are configurations where the fiber can be still ``standing'' because the intra-fiber vdW interaction has effectively increased fiber stiffness (see Figure~\ref{subfig:hex_chain} and Figure~\ref{subfig:leaning_hex_chain}).

	\end{table}
For the compression experiment a fiber is initially standing (see Figure~\ref{subfig:erect}). The primary focus is equilibrium configurations of the fiber under varying loads on the top substrate. Initially the top substrate is sufficiently far away from every particle on the fiber to prevent any vdW interaction, thus a non-zero vertical load is required to bring the top substrate in contact with the fiber. A set of reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:compression_reference} are used in every case unless values are explicitly stated otherwise.

\subsection{Reference parameters}

There are obvious qualitative delineations of the plot by color but the categorization of the associated fiber configuration is not trivial.
		\label{fig:push:ref}}
	\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref} presents the equilibrium behavior of an initially standing fiber under varying load for which adhesion is colored by (\ref{eqn:adhesion:top}). Analysis of contour plots of this kind will be the main focus of the results presented for the compression experiment. As with the free-standing experiment, the black region of the plot corresponds to a flattened configuration (see Figure~\ref{subfig:flattened}). Aside from the black region there is a white region, and three distinct grey regions with sufficiently large magnitude of the load. We will explore the different regions by considering representative equilibrium configurations.

For the darkest grey region we select $\lambda=14$ and $\mu=10.5$ as seen in Figure~\ref{subfig:flat_loop}. The configuration has one buckling point or a \textit{kink}. A \textit{kink} is a region of the fiber that consists of relatively few particles and has sharp interior angles between bonds. This is in contrast to what we consider a \textit{bend} of a region of the fiber which consists of potentially many particles with small interior angles between bonds. For the darkest grey region we conjecture that as the angle of the load on the top substrate, $\theta$, is increased from $45$\textdegree, the point at which the kink in the fiber occurs will move up the chain, thus causing less particles to be adhered.

	\end{figure*}

The next grey region corresponding to slightly larger $\theta$ does not have any observable difference between it and the previous region. Configurations shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:lonely_pancake} or configurations very similar to it were observed in both grey regions of the plot. Although the pattern associated with the adhesion heuristic is not obvious it appears that with stronger vertical component, $\lambda$, the fiber contains more buckling points.

Figure~\ref{subfig:crushed} describes the kinds of configurations that are found in the white region. The fiber is ``crushed'' by the load of the top substrate causing several kinks and bends. We observe both adhesion to the top substrate and crystallization of equilibrium configurations in this region. 

Distinct behavior of the fiber is observed for the interface between dark and light grey regions near $\theta=90$\textdegree\ with large magnitude and the interface between white and black regions near $\theta=45$\textdegree\ with small magnitude. Figure~\ref{subfig:tight_loop} and Figure~\ref{subfig:tight_hairpin} are example configurations for each interface of the plot respectively. Both configurations have bends in contrast to other configurations with kinks and similar loads.

From all configurations we note that an increase in $\beta$ correspondes to bends consisting of many particles instead of kinks consisting of few particles.\label{fig:bending_fiber}}	
	\end{figure*}

\subsection{Varying $\beta$}

The strength of the torsional spring, $\beta$, plays an important role in determining if the fiber is in a flattened or a standing equilibrium configuration. For the reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:compression_reference} $\beta$ is strong enough such that the fiber is free-standing in absence of external load. However, decreasing the reference value of $\beta$ by an order of magnitude would make it too small for the fiber to stand freely. Because of this we focus on increasing $\beta$.

Increasing $\beta$ by an order of magnitude such that $\beta=100$ significantly alters the picture from before. Shown in Figure~\ref{fig:push:b100} the black region of the plot is larger and grey and white regions are narrow and have different shape. The difference in configurations for each region has to do with how many fiber particles form a bend or if there is more than one bend. We present two examples: Figure~\ref{subfig:short_loop} corresponds to the black line inside the darker grey region, and Figure~\ref{subfig:hairpin} corresponds to $\theta=90$\textdegree\ with large magnitude.

The grey region of the contour plot is a similar configuration in Figure~\ref{subfig:short_loop} with the exception that more of the fiber is folded underneath itself causing a wave-like curve. The white regions also are similar to the example given in Figure~\ref{subfig:hairpin}. There is variability in the adhesion heuristic but it is because of small variation in number of particles that are part of the bends of the fiber. This is the same idea shown in Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref} where slightly lighter portions of grey regions were observed because of a kink appearing slightly farther up the fiber.

Increasing $\beta$ by another order of magnitude, $\beta=1000$, again significantly alters the picture. Figure~\ref{fig:push:b1000} shows the contour plot with this modification. Most notable is the loss of a black region, and a significantly smaller white region. The gradient of the grey region is represented in its entirety with Figure~\ref{subfig:curved}. Any configuration in the grey region is only a fiber with a gradual bend from the root to the first adhered particle on the top substrate. This configuration exists for $\beta=1000$ and likely can not be observed for smaller $\beta=10$ or $\beta=100$. The white region in contrast is similar to the same kind of configurations seen in the grey regions of $\beta=100$ with the exception of more particles forming a bend (see Figure~\ref{subfig:long_loop}).

Note in Figure~\ref{fig:push:b1000} that with relatively small horizontal component of the load the number of adhered particles increases, where in comparison it takes a large increase in the vertical component. This is in agreement with prior work of fiber adhesion continuum models \cite{Majidi2009}.

	\end{figure*}

\subsection{Varying $\eps_-$ and $\eps_+$} \label{subsection:push:eps}

Another method of allowing a fiber to stand instead of move to a flattened configuration is to decrease the vdW interaction strengths. Namely, we are interested in decreasing the vdW interaction strengths of both substrates, first independently and then together.

As a fiber is being compressed by the top substrate, it either began the process of adhering to the bottom substrate before the top substrate was able to interact with it, or stood freely and is compressed by the top substrate. For the reference parameters the fiber will not collapse on its own. Decreasing vdW interaction strength of the bottom substrate, $\eps_-=0.1$, is a further relaxation that emphasizes the vdW interaction with the top substrate over the vdW interaction with the bottom substrate. However, after the fiber has been compressed the bottom substrate can stiffen the fiber's configuration. Figure~\ref{fig:push:eb0.1} shows the contour plot with this modification. Although there are noticeable differences, the picture is qualitatively similar to that for the reference parameters, Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref}.

In contrast, when we decrease the strength of vdW interactions between the fiber and the top substrate, $\eps_+=0.1$, the picture becomes significantly more complex (see Figure~\ref{fig:push:et0.1}). Previously we partitioned contour plots into regions using the adhesion heuristic as a guide. However, when we decrease vdW interaction strength the complexity in configurations becomes difficult to manage. In Figure~\ref{fig:push:et0.1} we have a white region for small magnitude of the load which corresponds to a ``hump'' configuration of the fiber (see Figure~\ref{subfig:hump}). The top substrate vdW interaction strength is weaker, which relaxes the constraints on the fiber, both during and after it is has been compressed. This allows for a kink to form near the root and for the fiber to completely adhere to the bottom substrate.

Decreasing strengths of vdW interactions with both substrates to $0.1$ leads to Figure~\ref{fig:push:eb0.1_et0.1}. With these modifications the primary modes of buckling involve parts of the fiber crystallizing. The grey region of the plot is similar to configurations shown in the reference parameters, specifically Figure~\ref{subfig:lonely_pancake}. The white region is also similar, consisting of ``crushed'' fiber configurations. Example configurations for decreased vdW interaction strength are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vdw_crushed}.

		\label{fig:push:g1000}}
	\end{figure}	

\subsection{Varying $\gamma$}

We modify the extensible spring constant to ensure that the reference value, $\gamma=100$, is sufficiently large to make bonds of fiber particles stiff. Figure~\ref{fig:push:g1000} for $\gamma=1000$ shows a contour plot similar to the reference plot (see Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref}). There are no qualitative differences between the plots, which suggests that our choice of $\gamma$ is adequate.

\subsection{Bottom substrate with uniform potential} \label{section:compression:pressure}

Typically in adhesion modeling the substrates are modeled as continuum and the interaction with the substrate is replaced by as distance-dependent pressure term. We investigate the difference between a continuum and discrete bottom substrates. We assume the bottom substrate is a continuum with vdW interaction between fiber particles and the bottom substrate given by an integral of the Lennard-Jones potential with respect to lateral direction.

Using the adhesion heuristic we see a similar picture to the reference parameters for the uniform potential (see Figure~\ref{fig:push:p1}). There are differences, notably the white region of the plot between the black and dark grey regions. This region is the same kind of ``hump'' configuration seen before in Figure~\ref{subfig:hump}. Overall, we conjecture from both plots, Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref} and Figure~\ref{fig:push:p1}, that the different potentials give the same general behavior from the point of view of adhesion for the equilibrium configurations of the fiber, with some exceptions. This however is a limited comparison and those exceptions might not be negligible.

In both the free-standing and compression experiments we focused on a range of values of interest and presented a contour plot in the parameter space using a heuristic for adhesion. With the detachment experiment,  we assume that there is a critical magnitude of the load applied to the top substrate such that it will \textit{detach} that substrate from the fiber. The top substrate is said to detach from the fiber at the point in time when no fiber particles adhere to it. If there is in fact a critical magnitude of the load for a given angle of the load then we can heuristically pick a sufficiently large magnitude such that the top substrate does detach and then bisect between that value and $0$. The existence of a critical magnitude for detachment is not guaranteed and we will discuss when it is a poor assumption.

All simulations for the detachment experiment begin with the system in a flattened configuration (see Figure~\ref{subfig:flattened}). Although there are several compressed configurations from the previous experiment here we focus only on the flattened configuration.

      \caption{The critical load for the top substrate to detach from the fiber in load magnitude versus load angle (left) and vertical versus horizontal component of the load axes (right). For any given angle the critical load is only approximate, thus there are actually two lines drawn, one solid black representing the smallest detachment load, and a dashed line beneath it representing the largest adhesive load. Each circle represents a specific simulation.
      \label{fig:pull:ref}}
   \end{figure}

\subsection{Reference parameters}

As with the compression experiment, we have a set of selected reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:detachment_reference}. Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref} shows the critical magnitude for detachment of the load as a function of the angle of the load on the left, and the same line plotted in terms of the components of the load on the right. There is a linear interpolation between every $4$th angle in the plot, which makes accurate determination of extrema difficult. But we are principally interested in qualitative trends. Every circle in the plot is a simulation for some specific value of $\lambda$ and $\mu$, and the color of the circle is the value of the adhesion heuristic (\ref{eqn:adhesion:top}). All plots of the critical magnitude for detachment will follow these patterns.

First, we observe that, once the top substrate has detached from the fiber, the equilibrium configuration returns to that observed in a corresponding free-standing experiment.
For the reference parameters, equilibrium configurations below the critical magnitude are all identical flattened configurations. In order to understand the mechanism of detachment, we now discuss the dynamics of the system subjected to a critical load

In the range $0 \leq \theta < 45$ the top substrate detaches from the fiber by sliding. The top substrate is said to ``slide'' if for a given particle on the top substrate it shifts from being adhered to one collection of fiber particles to being adhered to a different collection of fiber particles in a finite amount of time. We conjecture that for zero vertical component of the load the sliding is shifting each particle in the top substrate from adhesion with the next adjacent pair of fiber particles, and as the vertical component of the load is decreased the sliding of the top substrate is relaxed such that it may ``skip'' certain adjacent particles and detach with smaller horizontal component. This is supported in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref} as the linear relationship between $\mu$ and $\lambda$ predicts that with increasing vertical component $\lambda$ the necessary horizontal component decreases (on either side of $\theta = 90$\textdegree).

   \begin{figure}[t]
      \begin{center}
         \includegraphics{./fig/ch3/pull/b10/grid.eps}
      \end{center}      
      \caption{Plot of the critical magnitude for detachment as in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref}. The torsional spring strength is increased, $\beta=10$, from the reference parameters in Table~\ref{table:detachment_reference}.
      \label{fig:pull:b10}}
   \end{figure}

Considering the range $45 \leq \theta < 90$ the top substrate continues the sliding mode of detachment up until what is assumed to be a critical angle where the effective horizontal displacement of a single particle on the top substrate is too small to slide over a single particle of the fiber. At this critical angle the mode of detachment changes from sliding to instant detachment. The top substrate is said to detach from the fiber ``instantly'' if the critical magnitude of the load is large enough to break all vdW bonds between the fiber and the top substrate simultaneously.

The range $90 \leq \theta \leq 180$ is similar. There is a critical angle of the load such that the top substrate changes from instant detachment from the fiber to detachment by sliding. However, the way in which sliding occurs is subtly different. There is also an observable asymmetry in the plot. One explanation is that if the top substrate pulls against the direction that the fiber has been flattened (in this case to the right) then the torsional spring energy will push a particle of the fiber up into the top substrate repelling it from the fiber making it easier to slide.

The plot on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:push:ref} tells the same story from a different perspective. With it we can see that the critical load is a linear relationship between the components of the load $\lambda$ and $\mu$ on either side of $\theta=90$\textdegree.
   
\subsection{Varying $\beta$}

   \begin{figure}[t]
      \begin{center}
         \includegraphics{./fig/ch3/pull/b100/grid.eps}
      \end{center}      
      \caption{Plot of the critical magnitude for detachment as in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref}. The torsional spring strength is increased, $\beta=100$.
      \label{fig:pull:b100}}
   \end{figure}

For the compression experiment $\beta$ was already sufficiently large for a fiber to stand freely. In the case of the detachment experiment $\beta=1$ is an order of magnitude lower and the fiber will not be able to stand freely. Like before, we focus only on increasing $\beta$.

With increased $\beta$ the story does not significantly change. Figure~\ref{fig:pull:b10} and Figure~\ref{fig:pull:b100} show plots that are similar in general shape to those for the reference parameters. The dynamics of detachment is also very similar to that for the reference parameters. However, the values of extrema are different with larger $\beta$. The local minimum of the critical detachment load to the left of the maximum value is larger as $\beta$ increases. In contrast, the minimum value to the right of the maximum value is smaller as $\beta$ increases. This means the asymmetry in the plot is more exaggerated with larger $\beta$. This observation is consistent with the given explanation for the asymmetry being related to the strength of torsional springs near the root particle of the fiber. Lastly, the maximum critical magnitude decreases as $\beta$ increases.

\subsection{Varying $\eps_-$, $\eps_+$, and $\eps$} \label{section:detachment:eps}

Varying vdW interaction strengths has the most significant effect that we have observed on the results of the detachment experiment. First, we consider decreasing $\eps_-$ and $\eps_+$ to $0.1$ and then all three vdW interactions, $\eps_- = \eps_+ = \eps = 0.1$. Second, we consider the case were only $\eps_-=0.1$ and the case where only $\eps_+=10$. Lastly, we consider decreasing $\eps_-$ further, exploring both $\eps_-=0.01$ and $\eps_-=0$.

For $\eps_- = \eps_+ = 0.1$ the critical magnitude for detachment is decreased for all angles of the load by approximately an order of magnitude relative to the critical magnitude of the reference parameters. Figure~\ref{fig:push:eb0.1_et0.1} demonstrates the linear relationship between the critical detachment load and the decrease in the substrate vdW interaction strengths. The modes of detachment are also the same. For $\theta$ sufficiently larger or smaller than $90$\textdegree\ the top substrate detaches in the sliding mode. It detaches in the instant detachment mode otherwise. The asymmetry of minimums of the plot is increased. The minimum value of the critical magnitude on the right is smaller than the reference parameters, and the  value on the left is larger, increasing the gap between the values. If we modify the fiber vdW interaction strength so that all values are equal, that is $\eps_- = \eps_+ = \eps = 0.1$, then the minimum values of the plot are less asymmetric (the gap is decreased). Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0.1_et0.1_e0.1} shows the critical detachment magnitude for these equal values. The observations we made for the prior plot (Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0.1_et0.1}) hold here as well. That is, all values of the critical detachment magnitude are approximately an order of magnitude lower than the reference case, and the modes of detachment are similar.

Consider instead that we decrease $\eps_-$ only, i.e., $\eps_-=0.1$. The plot of the critical detachment magnitude in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0.1} is of a comparatively similar shape to that for the reference parameters but there is plateau on either side of $\theta=90$\textdegree. Also, for $\theta$ near $0$\textdegree\ there is an interesting change in the method of detachment for the top substrate. In fact, the modes of detachment are different from the prior two modes, sliding and instant detachment, for all values of $\theta$. For $\theta$ not near the maximum value of the critical detachment magnitude there is a new mode of detachment consisting of propagating waves. The substrate can still be considered as sliding and it may be that the mechanics of sliding for the reference parameters are precisely the same as what gives propagating waves for this modification of parameters. Likewise, for $\theta$ near $90$\textdegree\ the dynamics of detachment is not via an instant detachment but by an ``unzipping'' of the fiber. Figure~\ref{subfig:travel_waves} shows the propagating waves at three distinct time steps, darker greys are later in time. Note that the waves do not travel through the fiber at a uniform speed. Figure~\ref{subfig:unzip} shows the ``unzipping'' of a fiber at three distinct time steps, colored in the same way. A fiber is said to ``unzip'' from a substrate if one particle breaks adhesion with the substrate at a time and in contiguous sequence from the initially detached particle. These two modes of detachment, unzipping and wave propagated sliding, seem to be the analogues of instant detachment and ``simple'' sliding we have discussed before. Not only are the previous two modes of detachment arguably special cases of these modes, the values of $\theta$ for which they occur are similar.

Values of $\theta$ near $0$\textdegree\ are interesting in there own right. Every simulation below the critical detachment magnitude up until this point has maintained the flattened configuration in agreement with our assumption that there is in fact a critical detachment magnitude of the load. This fails to be the case for small values of $\theta$ when $\eps_-=0.1$. The simulation marked by a star in the plot of Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0.01} represents what we call an \textit{isolated detachment magnitude}. For many simulation points in the same region of the plot the adhesion of the fiber is also noticeably less than any other simulation, which is because this is the only time the fiber has folded up and onto itself during the detachment. Figure~\ref{subfig:folded_over} shows the equilibrium configuration for a load on the top substrate that is not an isolated detachment magnitude. An explanation for this behavior is that if the amplitude and frequency of the propagating waves is just right, the particles on the fiber start crystallizing, stiffening the fiber and ultimately pulling it over onto itself as the detachment mode temporarily degenerates to simple sliding. The cause of isolated detachment magnitudes is then a complicated issue of whether or not the fiber particles crystallize with the particles on the top substrate in such a way to stay adhered or if the substrate has moved laterally a sufficient amount already to avoid re-adhering particles. Re-adhering particles are fiber particles shown near the root particle in Figure~\ref{subfig:folded_over}.

We attempt to avoid the issue of isolated detachment magnitudes by performing an additional simulation with a magnitude slightly larger for any simulation where the top substrate detaches from the fiber. Even if there are isolated detachment magnitudes there is still good reason to believe that there is a boundary between magnitudes of the load that cause the top substrate to strictly detach regardless of how large the values are. In an attempt to avoid isolated detachment magnitudes and find this boundary in all cases we believe the additional simulation is a satisfactory heuristic.

Increasing $\eps_+$ by an order of magnitude from the reference parameters alone has comparable effects to decreasing $\eps_-$.
The two modes of detachment previously described are still present, namely that of unzipping and wave propagated sliding.
However, those detachment modes can also be mixed. For some values of $\theta$ near $0$\textdegree\ the mode of detachment is still sliding and the plateau in $\theta$ is still related to a notion of a critical $\theta$ where the mode of detachment shifts (in this case from mixed to strictly unzipping), but in between these modes there is a mixture of both.
First, the detachment mode will be wave propagated sliding and then, after sufficiently many waves have been generated, the mode will switch to unzipping.
We conjecture that waves are generated with higher amplitude and frequency and so when enough waves are present in the fiber the top substrate is only adhered to a fraction of fiber particles and can then change modes of detachment to unzipping.
Note also that the behavior of the fiber near $\theta=0$ is more similar to the reference plot (see Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref}) than the plot of $\eps_-=0.1$.

Last, we decrease $\eps_-$ to values $0.01$ and $0$. The plot of the critical magnitude has been relatively comparable for all values that we have seen so far with only minor disparities. When we decrease $\eps_-$ even further than we did previously the picture changes significantly. In Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0.01} the values of the critical magnitude are much smaller than the reference parameter values and still smaller than the critical magnitude values of $\eps_-=0.1$. For $\theta$ near $0$\textdegree\ the same dynamics of the fiber folding over occurs. There are likely isolated detachment magnitudes below the critical magnitude line even though none are shown in the plot. The primary mode of detachment is unzipping. Sliding only appears to occur for values of $\theta$ near either $0$\textdegree\ or $180$\textdegree. The asymmetry in the plot must be caused by the direction the fiber is flattened although the exact relationship between the two is not understood. When $\eps_-$ is decreased to the point of vanishing, i.e., $\eps_-=0$, we have a similar plot as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:eb0}. The notable differences are values near $\theta=0$, which gives an equilibrium configuration shown in Figure~\ref{subfig:barely_adhered}. It is clear that the magnitude of the load on the top substrate is not strong enough to break a single adhesive bond between the top substrate and a fiber particle. Thus, the configuration is in large part caused by the torsional spring strength. An important detail is that the detachment mode of unzipping is a concerted effort between the vdW interaction strengths, the torsional spring strength, and the magnitude of the load on the top substrate.

\subsection{Varying $\gamma$}

   \begin{figure}[t]
      \begin{center}
         \includegraphics{./fig/ch3/pull/g1000/grid.eps}
      \end{center}

      \label{fig:pull:g1000}}
   \end{figure}

We modify the extensible spring constant to ensure the reference selection, $\gamma=100$, is sufficiently stiff. Although larger values of $\gamma$ will alter the dynamics and equilibrium configurations we want extensible springs to be able to relax without significant changes between results with our selected value and larger values. Figure~\ref{fig:pull:g1000} shows the plot of the critical magnitude of the load. The similarity between this plot and the reference plot in Figure~\ref{fig:pull:ref} suggests our selection of $\gamma$ is sufficient.


\subsection{Bottom substrate with uniform potential} \label{section:detachment:pressure}

   \begin{figure}[t!]

      \label{fig:pull:p10}}
   \end{figure}

In section~\ref{section:compression:pressure} we replaced the bottom substrate particle-particle potential with a uniform potential. We make the same modification here and briefly discuss the effects on the model under the detachment experiment.

Figure~\ref{fig:pull:p1} and Figure~\ref{fig:pull:p10} show the critical magnitude of the load with the modified bottom substrate potential. The dynamics of the detachment is the same as for the reference parameters, i.e., that there are two detachment modes: sliding and instant detachment. There is still a maximum of the critical load near $\theta=90$\textdegree\ and still likely a critical angle were the detachment mode changes. However, the minimums on either side of the plot have changed. An explanation is that there is no resistance for the fiber particles to prevent horizontal displacement because the potential is uniform. Any vertical component of the load does not assist the top substrate in detaching from the fiber which means the minimums on the left and right of the plot should be at $\theta=0$ and $\theta=180$.

\section{Conclusion}

Three separate experiments for the model were conducted in order to understand possible equilibrium configurations. An adhesive heuristic was used in all experiments to qualitatively categorize equilibrium configurations. For the free-standing experiment a linear relationship was observed between $\eps_-$ and $\beta$ describing the change from a slanted to flattened configuration. Another linear relationship between flattened and crystallizing configurations was also observed. The compression experiment also gave proportional relationships between $\lambda$ and $\mu$ for many of the explored ranges of parameters. Large values of $\beta$ and smaller values of $\eps_+$ gave significantly different results from the reference parameters. The detachment experiment demonstrated different dynamics of detachment (sliding and unzipping) and that a critical magnitude for detachment existed with some explainable exceptions. The detachment experiment also showed two local minimums for the critical magnitude and one maximum as a function of $\theta$ for the reference parameters and variations of the reference parameters.
