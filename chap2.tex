\section{Geometry}

   We consider a collection of particles linked into a chain that we call a fiber. Each fiber is connected to a stationary horizontal (bottom) substrate at some fixed position. We also consider a (top) substrate that is always parallel to the bottom substrate and that only translates. There are two artificial particles associated with each fiber, one at the connection (or attachment) point with the bottom substrate and an additional particle placed at any point on a half circle below the bottom substrate of radius one. We call the particle at the attachment point the attachment particle, and the other particle below it the floating particle (see Figure~\ref{fig:Geometry}). The system consists of $m$ fibers, with $n_j$ particles for the $j$th fiber, a top substrate with $n_+$ particles, and a bottom substrate with $n_-$ particles.
	
We denote the position vector of the $i$th particle on the $j$th fiber by
\begin{equation}
	\textbf{r}_i^{(j)} = (x_i^{(j)},y_i^{(j)})
\end{equation}
where $1 \leq j \leq m$ and $1 \leq i \leq n_j$. We also define the following vectors for convenience,
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} = \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} - \textbf{r}_{i-1}^{(j)}.
\end{equation}
The two artificial particles are denoted as follows,
\begin{equation}
	\textbf{r}_0^{(j)} = (x_0^{(j)},y_0^{(j)}) = (\delta_j,0)
\end{equation}
for the attachment particle and
\begin{equation}
	\textbf{r}_{-1}^{(j)} = (x_{-1}^{(j)},y_{-1}^{(j)}).
\end{equation}
for the floating particle.

	The chain of particles is a discrete analog to a CNT (see Figure~\ref{subfig:NanotubeParticle}). Indeed, the vectors $\Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)}$ conceptually represent the interparticle bonds in this geometry. However, this approach is sufficiently generic to describe other fiber structures and we do not limit our discussion to this motivation.
	
	The bottom substrate as described before is attached to every fiber at the attachment particle. We define two position vectors,
\begin{eqnarray}
	\textbf{r}_0^{(+)} = (x_0^{(+)},y_0^{(+)}) & \\
	\textbf{r}_i^{(+)} = (x_0^{(+)} + i\ell_+,y_0^{(+)}), & 0 < i < n_+
\end{eqnarray}
for the top substrate and,
\begin{eqnarray}
	\textbf{r}_0^{(-)} = (x_0^{(-)},y_0^{(-)}) & \\
	\textbf{r}_i^{(+)} = (x_0^{(+)} + i\ell_-,y_0^{(+)}), & 0 < i < n_-
\end{eqnarray} 
for the bottom substrate. Since both substrates are rigid, the bottom substrate is stationary, and the top substrate is only allowed to translate, the positions of all particles on each substrate can be respectively specified by identifying the position of a single particle. Both particles are decided as initial conditions together with the initial positions of every particle on each fiber. The rest of the particles on either substrate are defined by a parameter for the total number of particles, and an interval spacing, $\ell_+$ and $\ell_-$.

\section{Energy}

	We want a fiber to be in equilibrium when all particles are collinear and each particle is a fixed distance $\ell$ away from its neighbors. In order to enforce this equilibrium configuration we incorporate two types of springs into the model: an extensible spring and a torsional spring.

\subsection{Extensible spring}

	The extensible spring is described by the standard Hooke's law with spring constant $\gamma$ and is meant to keep any two adjacent particles on a fiber a fixed distance $\ell$ apart. The energy for all extensible springs in the system is then
\begin{equation}
	E_e = \gamma \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \left[ \left( \|\Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} \| - \ell \right)^2 \right].
\end{equation}
Note that there is no spring between the floating particle and the attachment particle, but there is a spring between the attachment particle and the $\textbf{r}_0^{(j)}$ particle on the $j$th fiber. Both the attachment particle and the floating particle are introduced into the system to model the connection between the fiber and the bottom substrate. The spring between the attachment particle, $\textbf{r}_0^{(j)}$, and the particle, $\textbf{r}_1^{(j)}$, enforces attachment of the $j$th fiber.

	\begin{figure}

		\label{fig:BendingEnergy}}
	\end{figure}	

\subsection{Torsional spring}

	The extensible springs alone are not sufficient to describe the kind of equilibrium we seek, so we introduce an energy penalty for bending, when the adjacent particles are not collinear (see Figure~\ref{fig:BendingEnergy}). We choose the expression,
\begin{equation}
	e_b = 2\beta \tan^2 \left( \frac{\Delta \theta}{2} \right),
\end{equation}
to represent the energy of a torsional spring at the junction between two bonds. Here $\beta$ is the strength of the spring. Notice this energy diverges as $\Delta \theta \to \pm180$\textdegree to guarantee that the bonds to do fold onto themselves. The geometry of the system is described in terms of particles, not angles, hence we rewrite the energy in terms of position vectors,
\begin{equation}
	E_b = 2\beta \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \left[ \frac{\|\Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} \| \|\Delta \textbf{r}_{i-1}^{(j)} \| - \Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} \cdot \Delta \textbf{r}_{i-1}^{(j)}}{\|\Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} \| \|\Delta \textbf{r}_{i-1}^{(j)} \| + \Delta \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} \cdot \Delta \textbf{r}_{i-1}^{(j)}} \right].
\end{equation}

	This energy incorporates every contiguous set of three particles, including the two artificial particles. With the incorporation of the angle between the artificial particles and the particle, $\textbf{r}_0^{(j)}$, the optimal angle of the fiber with respect to the substrate can be tuned according to the placement of the floating particle. For example, if the angle between the artificial bond connecting the floating particle to the attachment particle, and the first bond connecting the attachment particle to particle $\textbf{r}_0^{(j)}$ is $90$\textdegree, then the entire fiber will want to be upright. If the equilibrium attachment angle is $45$\textdegree, then the entire fiber will want be slanted at $45$\textdegree,~etc. 

   The system of extensible and torsional springs is sufficient to model the equilibrium behavior of a system of isolated noninteracting fibers. However, we are still motivated by a nanoscale setting, namely that of CNTs. We introduce a particle-particle interaction to model the kinds of molecular forces we would expect on a nanoscale.

\subsection{van der Waals interactions}

	\end{figure*}

   Van der Waals' (vdW) interaction are used to describe the sum of attractive and repulsive forces of atomic structures that are not accounted for by their covalent bonds. In a CNT setting we consider the extensible spring already described as an abstraction of covalent bonding of carbon atoms but we have yet to account for any vdW interaction. We use a truncated Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential to represent the vdW interactions between each particle in the model. The Lennard-Jones potential is parameterized by the strength of the interaction, $\varepsilon$, and the equilibrium distance between two interacting particles, $\sigma$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:LJ}). An exception is made for particles with an extensible spring between them. Stated precisely, there is vdW interaction between every particle and every other particle except if the two particles are adjacent on the same fiber.
	
The standard Lennard-Jones potential,
\begin{equation}
	U(x; \varepsilon, \sigma) = \varepsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^{12} - 2 \left( \frac{\sigma}{x} \right)^6 \right],
\end{equation}

	\end{figure*}	

\noindent	
asymptotically approaches zero as $x$ approaches infinity. This makes Lennard-Jones a short range potential and, more importantly, makes interactions at long distances negligible. We can truncate (or cut) the potential at some radius $r_c$. However, this introduces a discontinuity in the potential, so in order to repair both the potential and it's derivative, we use the following modification,
\begin{equation}
	U_c(x; \varepsilon, \sigma) = \left\{ 
		\begin{array}{lr}
			U(x; \varepsilon, \sigma) - U(r_c; \varepsilon, \sigma) - \frac{dU}{dx}\bigg|_{x = r_c}(x - r_c), & x \leq r_c\\
			0, & x > r_c
		\end{array}
		\right. 
\end{equation}

	The sequence of truncated Lennard-Jones potentials converges to the Lennard-Jones potential as $r_c \to \infty$ and the truncated Lennard-Jones potentials share the same asymptotic behavior (see Figure~\ref{fig:LJT}). This truncation technique is referred to as shifted forces, it is commonly used to conserve energy in the potential and avoid potential artifacts with a model. The discontinuous truncation is also used but can cause larger discrepancies in energy particularly with very long simulations. Although this method alters the potential everywhere the accuracy with respect to the true potential has been observed in molecular dynamics simulations as better than the discontinuous truncation \cite{Toxvaerd2011}.
	
  Time dependent simulations leading to equilibrium for large systems can require long time intervals, so to avoid artifacts in the geometry we use the continuous variation of the truncated Lennard-Jones potential. Moreover, we pick a conservative cutoff selection of $r_c = 8$ in all simulations to further ensure accuracy of equilibrium configurations.

	In order to represent concisely the set of particles that a given particle is interacting with, we define the set
\begin{equation}
	P(j,i) = \{ (h,k)|j \neq h \vee k \neq i \pm 1, 1 \leq h \leq m, 1 \leq k \leq n_h \},
\end{equation}
which contains every particle that the $i$th particle on the $j$th fiber interacts with via the truncated 12-6 potential. Now we can express the vdW energy for the system,
\begin{multline}
	E_v = \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \bigg[ \sum_{(h,k) \in P(j,i)} U_c \left( \| \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} - \textbf{r}_k^{(h)} \|; \varepsilon, \sigma \right) \\ + \sum_{k=1}^{n_-} U_c \left( \| \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} - \textbf{r}_k^{(-)} \|; \varepsilon_-, \sigma \right) + \sum_{k=1}^{n_+} U_c \left( \| \textbf{r}_i^{(j)} - \textbf{r}_k^{(+)} \|; \varepsilon_+, \sigma \right) \bigg].
\end{multline}
It is not the case that the interaction strength is the same for each potential. There are different strengths for fiber to fiber, fiber to top substrate, and fiber to bottom substrate interactions.

%\begin{equation}
%	E_p = \sum_{j=1}^m \sum_{i=1}^{en_j} U_p \left( y_i^{(j)} \right)
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Total energy}

With both springs and vdW interaction the system of fibers and the bottom substrate is complete. What is left is the rigid motion of the top substrate. We apply a load on the $0$th particle of the top substrate with vertical component $\lambda$ and horizontal component $\mu$. This is consistent with applying a load to the center of mass of the top substrate.

We have described the model so far as different partial energies. It comes as no surprise then that the total energy for the system is

% Total energy
\begin{equation}
	E = E_b + E_e + E_v + \lambda x_0^{(+)} - \mu y_0^{(+)}.
\end{equation}
The model for the system includes two springs, the extensible and torsional springs, the vdW interaction, and the rigid motion of the top substrate. Note that $\lambda$ is flipped from what might be considered intuition. Positive values of $\lambda$ will move the top substrate ``down'' towards the fiber, instead of ``up''.

\section{Dynamics}

Using Newton's second law with a damping term we have,

\begin{equation}
	M\frac{d^2\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}{dt^2} + \frac{d\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}{dt} = -\nabla_{\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}E,
\end{equation}
for the $i$th particle on the $j$th fiber, where $M$ is the mass of the particle. We assume the mass of particles we want to take into consideration are small enough to make the acceleration negligible. This gives us,

\begin{equation}
	 \frac{d\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}{dt} = -\nabla_{\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}E.
\end{equation}
Approximating the derivative with a backwards difference gives us gradient descent,

\begin{equation}
    \textbf{r}_i^{(j),n} = \textbf{r}_i^{(j),n-1} - dt\nabla_{\textbf{r}_i^{(j)}}E.
\end{equation}
Clearly solving this ordinary differential equation will minimize the total energy.

The gradient flow dynamics of the governing equation have to be considered with the understanding that we assume our particles have sufficiently small mass. The model itself is abstract but it must be not be divorced from this assumption.

\section{Implementation}

   The implementation for the simulations that follow in Chapter~\ref{chap:three} and Chapter~\ref{chap:four} have a few implementation details that may be important to understand. We discuss those details here in order to give the reader a glimpse into what they might consider important factors in how to interpret results.

   The use of a truncated Lennard-Jones potential allows for an optimization that improves the average number of interactions that need to be computed. The optimization used in this work is a Verlet neighor list. However, using such a list leads to other important considerations, namely how it is to be updated. The trade off becomes an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ algorithm at each time step to determine if the list needs to be updated. Each time step the two largest displacements of unique particles are computed. If the sum of these displacements is larger than the buffer distance of the Verlet neighbor list then the list must be updated. The buffer zone in our case is the distance from our cutoff, $r_c = 8$, and a second cutoff, $r_{max} = 12$. For all simulations discussed here we have a buffer radius of $4$. Verlet neighbor lists are not the only manner of implementing the optimization and the reader may be interested in other solutions, such as cell lists.

   Equilibrium configurations are hard to decide on because we don't have infinite computation time to make sure nothing changes numerically. To ensure that the algorithm eventually stops we need an equilibrium criterion that when satisfied declares the system in equilibrium. In our case the equilibrium criterion is relative. That is, we take the norm distance between the current state vector and the prior state vector of the system. If this distance is less than a tolerance, $10^{-8}$, we mark the system as in equilibrium. However, we go one step further and require that this condition be satisfied persistently for ten time steps.

   There is another kind of equilibrium that is used to end early on simulations. If we have a load with negative or no vertical component, $\lambda$, then we likely only interested in how the top substrate interacts with the fibers of the system. If the top substrate is not interacting at all because it's too far away, then it is not coming back. That is, if the displacement of the top substrate $0$th particle is within $10^{-8}$ of it's maximum displacement, $\sqrt{\lambda^2 + \mu^2}$, then we say the system is in equilibrium. As before, this must hold for ten time steps before the simulation ends and the final decision is made.

   Finally, there are two versions of the code, MATLAB \cite{MATLAB2010} and C/C++. All results shown in this work use the C version only. However, the MATLAB version came first and the correctness of the C/C++ version was considered in relation to it. The software package used to evolve the system each time step was SUNDIALS, and in particular CVODE \cite{sundials}. All figures displayed in this work were generated using MatPlotLib \cite{Hunter2007}. The MATLAB and C/C++ simulation code, as well as the python visualization code are provided in appendices.
