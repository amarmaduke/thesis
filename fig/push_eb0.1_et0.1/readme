BBox improvement:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -q -sDEVICE=bbox .

Like the reference, except greater ability to crumple along the edges,
fiber folding in on itself. Perhaps crumple is the wrong word.
With just pushing straight down the folds are pretty similar.
Pushing with a slant allows the fiber to fold against itself creating
one to many folds. Expands the edges of "totally flat"



Figure sindex's:
crumple : 259
crumple2 : 284
crumple3" 248
