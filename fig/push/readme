BBox improvement:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -q -sDEVICE=bbox .


When the angle applied is more diagonal, you get squished (black area)
As you get closer to pushing directly down you find more folds
Greater magnitude leads to more squishing (curled2)
As you go away from direct downard pressure you get varying kinks


Figure sindex's:
squished : 344
one_fold : 292
curled1 : 223
cureld2 : 228
two_folds : 298
